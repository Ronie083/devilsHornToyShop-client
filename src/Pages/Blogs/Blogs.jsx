                            <li>An access token is a credential that represents the authorization granted to a user or client application to access protected resources.</li>
                            <li>It is typically short-lived and has an expiration time.</li>
                            <li>Access tokens are commonly used in bearer authentication schemes, where the token itself is sufficient to access protected resources.</li>
                            <li>When a user or client application makes a request to access a protected resource, the access token is included in the request headers or as a parameter.</li>
                            <li>The server validates the access token and grants or denies access to the requested resource based on the token&apos;s validity and permissions.</li>

                            <li>A refresh token is a long-lived credential used to obtain a new access token when the current access token expires.</li>
                            <li>Refresh tokens are typically issued alongside an access token during the authentication process.</li>
                            <li>Unlike access tokens, refresh tokens are not sent with every request to access protected resources.</li>
                            <li>When an access token expires, the client application can make a request to a designated endpoint with the refresh token to obtain a new access token.</li>
                            <li>The server verifies the refresh token&apos;s validity and issues a new access token if the refresh token is valid and not expired.</li>

                            <li>SQL databases are based on a structured schema that defines the tables, columns, and relationships between them. Data is organized into rows and columns.</li>
                            <li> SQL databases follow the relational data model, where data is stored in tables with predefined schemas. Relationships between tables are established using foreign keys.</li>
                            <li>: SQL databases use the Structured Query Language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. SQL provides a standardized way to interact with the database.</li>
                            <li>SQL databases emphasize ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, ensuring data integrity and reliability.</li>

                            <li> NoSQL databases are schema-less or have flexible schemas, allowing for dynamic and unstructured data storage. They can handle semi-structured and polymorphic data formats.</li>
                            <li>NoSQL databases use various data models like key-value, document, columnar, or graph. The data model can be chosen based on the specific requirements of the application.</li>
                            <li>NoSQL databases may have their own query languages, but some also support SQL-like querying. Some NoSQL databases provide APIs for data access and manipulation.</li>
                            <li>NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, allowing them to distribute data across multiple servers or clusters to handle large-scale data and high traffic loads.</li>

                    <div className="grid flex-grow p-4 card bg-white rounded-box place-items-center shadow-md">Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js. It provides a minimalistic and flexible set of features for building web applications and APIs. Express.js simplifies the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, middleware integration, and response generation. It is known for its simplicity and unopinionated nature, allowing developers to have fine-grained control over their application&apos;s behavior.
                        <br />
                        <p className="font-bold">Key features of Express.js include:</p>
                        <ul className="list-decimal pl-4">
                            <li>Routing: Express.js provides a routing system that allows developers to define routes for handling HTTP requests based on different URL patterns and HTTP methods.</li>
                            <li>Middleware: Express.js supports middleware functions that can be used to perform additional processing on incoming requests or outgoing responses. Middleware functions can be used for tasks such as authentication, request parsing, logging, error handling, and more.</li>
                            <li>Templating: Express.js allows the use of template engines to generate dynamic HTML pages. Popular template engines such as EJS, Pug, and Handlebars can be easily integrated with Express.js.</li>

It is built on top of Express.js and provides an opinionated structure and set of features for developing robust applications.

                            <li>Modular architecture: Nest.js promotes a modular architecture that helps organize the application&apos;s components into reusable and encapsulated modules. This approach allows for better maintainability and scalability of the codebase.
                            </li>
                            <li>TypeScript support: Nest.js is built with TypeScript and leverages its features such as static typing, decorators, and advanced OOP concepts. This brings enhanced type safety, better code organization, and improved development experience.
                            </li>
                            <li>Dependency injection: Nest.js provides a powerful dependency injection system, which helps manage dependencies between different components of the application. This makes it easier to write testable and modular code.

                <div className="flex flex-col w-full">
                    <div className="grid flex-grow p-4 card bg-white rounded-box place-items-center shadow-md">In MongoDB, the aggregate function is used to perform advanced data aggregation operations on collections. It allows you to process and transform the data in multiple stages to obtain the desired results. The aggregate function takes an array of stages as its argument, where each stage represents a specific operation or transformation to be applied to the data.
                        <br />
                        <p className="font-bold">Here is an overview of how the aggregate function works:</p>
                        <ul className="list-decimal pl-4">
                            <li>Pipeline Stages: The aggregate function processes data using a pipeline approach, where each stage represents a specific operation. Each stage receives the input documents from the previous stage and performs a transformation or computation on the data.
                            </li>
                            <li>Pipeline Operators: MongoDB provides a variety of pipeline operators that can be used in different stages to shape and manipulate the data. These operators include filtering, sorting, grouping, projecting, aggregating, and more. Each operator performs a specific task on the input documents and produces the modified output.
                            </li>
                            <li>Chaining Stages: You can chain multiple stages together to create a pipeline of operations. The output of one stage becomes the input for the next stage, allowing you to perform a series of transformations on the data.
                            </li>
                            <li>Result: The final stage in the pipeline typically includes an operation to shape the output data according to your requirements. This can involve grouping the data, calculating aggregates, projecting specific fields, or performing any other desired transformations.
                            </li>
                            <li>Execution: When you invoke the aggregate function, MongoDB processes the pipeline stages in the specified order and returns the transformed data as the result. The result can be further processed, displayed, or used for further operations in your application.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        The aggregate function is powerful and flexible, allowing you to perform complex data operations and computations on your MongoDB collections. It is particularly useful for tasks such as generating reports, performing statistical analysis, data summarization, and more. By leveraging the aggregation framework, you can achieve efficient and optimized data processing within MongoDB.
